# PicoGym: Crack the Gate 2

**Author:** *Yahaya Meddy*

---

## Description:

> The login system has been upgraded with a basic rate-limiting mechanism that locks out repeated failed attempts from the same source. We’ve received a tip that the system might still trust user-controlled headers. Your objective is to bypass the rate-limiting restriction and log in using the known email address: `ctf-player@picoctf.org` and uncover the hidden secret.
> 
> Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

**Files provided:** `passwords.txt (ASCII text)`
**URL:** <https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/521>

## Initial Reconnaissance:

After spawning the instance, we are given a list of passwords, after running `wc -l` reveals that we have 19 distinct passwords, they appear to be in ROT-13 just like the HTML comment was last time.

Testing the first string in `passwords.txt`:
```Bash
echo 'l9xKfsH0' | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
y9kXsfU0
```

Doesn't look like it though. Nor does `base64` lead to anything either. I'm confident these are just **plain high-entropy passwords.**
### Figuring out the Rate Limit:

After sending about 2 requests, you get the following error:
```Bash
curl -s -X POST http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:56606/login \ 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org","password":"test"}'
{"success":false,"error":"Too many failed attempts. Please try again in 20 minutes."}
```

So as the task mentioned, rate limiting is involved. One of the hints suggests at using `X-Forwarded-For`

## Step 2: Finding the Vulnerability / Key Insight:

What was the "aha" moment? This is the most valuable part of a writeup.

## Step 3: Exploitation / Solving:

Walk through exactly what you did step by step.
```python
# any scripts you wrote
```
