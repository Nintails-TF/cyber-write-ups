# PicoGym: Crack the Gate 1

**Author:** *Yahaya Meddy*

## Description:

> We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, CTF player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: `ctf-player@picoctf.org`. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out? The website is running [here](http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:60574/). Can you try to log in?

**Files provided:** N/A
**URL:** <https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/520>

## Initial Reconnaissance:

First I decided to look at the source code of the webpage, then I saw the following comments.
```HTML
<!-- ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf" -->
<!-- Remove before pushing to production! -->
```

This doesn't look like `base64`, but after googling it, we can figure out that this is a `ROT13/Rotate 13` cipher!

### Explaining ROT Ciphers:

Rotation ciphers are a basic form of substitution ciphers. Meaning that in the case of ROT-13 you shift a letter forward 13 characters (`e.g. a -> n`). In the case of ROT-13, we could rotate either forward or backwards to decode the text. 

But for when the shift isn't half of the alphabet, like with ROT-10.
- Forward 10: `a -> k`
- Backwards 10: `q <- a`
	- **Backwards 10 is the same as Forward 16!** (`a -> q`)

As a convention, we describe all ciphers in a forward shift format, as it clearer for programs and mathematical formula.

The special case of ROT-13, is that it is a **Involutory Function (Self-inversing Function)**, if we wanted to decrypt ROT-13 text, we can just "encrypt" it again to get the plaintext.

XOR (exclusive OR) works in a similar way as ROT-13.

### Getting Plaintext from the Comment:

We can use the `tr/translate` command within our terminal to rotate back to the plaintext.

```bash
echo 'Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf"' | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

Explanation:
- `'A-Za-z'`: Means look at each upper and lowercase letter within our echoed text.
- `'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`: We map from the ciphertext back to the plaintext.
	- Note that in both examples we need to specify both upper (`A-Z/N-ZA-M`) and lowercase (`a-z/n-za-m`).

Giving us the output of:
```bash
Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes"
```

## Exploitation:

Now we know to change the header, we can use `cURL`:

```Bash
curl -X POST -H "X-Dev-Access: yes" -d "email=ctf-player@picoctf.org&password=anypassword" http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:62669/login
{"success":true,"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org","firstName":"pico","lastName":"player","flag":"picoCTF{brut4_f0rc4_49d1d186}"}
```

Explanation:
- `-X POST`: Forms need a POST command to actually login
- `-H "X-Dev-Access: yes"`: We define our bypass as the comment specifies
- `-d "email=ctf-player@picoctf.org&password=password"`
	- We use the username provided by the challenge description and any generic password.
- `http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:62669/login`
	- Finally, we input the challenge URL. We can see within the raw HTML that the `<script>` tag contains JavaScript which denotes that the `/login` endpoint.

### Extension - Finding an Endpoint?

In real engagements (and harder challenges), we aren't going to be handed endpoints on a silver platter. **So what techniques can we use to find them?**

#### 1. The "Live" Method (Observation)

- **How:** Use Browser Developer Tools (Network Tab) or a proxy tool like **Burp Suite**.

- **Action:** Perform an action on the site (like clicking "Submit") and inspect the headers to see where the request was sent (e.g., `/login`).

- **Why:** This is the quickest and most reliable method for finding active endpoints.

#### 2. Static Analysis (Code Review)

- **Traditional:** Scan the HTML source for `action` attributes or `href` links.
    
- **Modern (React/Vue):** Look at bundled `.js` files like `main.js` or `app.js`. Search these files for strings like `http`, `api/`, or `/v1/` to find hardcoded endpoints.
    
- **Why:** Developers often leave a "map" of the entire API inside the client-side JavaScript.

#### 3. Directory Brute-Forcing (Fuzzing)

- **How:** Use a tool like **FFUF**, **Gobuster**, or **Dirb** paired with a massive wordlist (like [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)).
    
- **Action:** The tool rapidly tries thousands of combinations (e.g., `/admin`, `/dev`, `/secret`) to see which ones return a `200 OK`.
    
- **Risk:** This can trigger rate-limiting or web application firewalls (WAFs), and it may miss non-standard naming conventions.

#### 4. Checking `robots.txt`

- **The "Hacker's Map":** Developers sometimes list sensitive paths here to hide them from Google. Since `robots.txt` is public, it’s essentially a sign saying: "Please hack this!"
    
- **Modern Alternative:** Most developers now use metadata tags like `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` directly on the page. 
	- This prevents search engine indexing without publicly advertising the URL.

## Flag:

```plaintext
picoCTF{brut4_f0rc4_49d1d186}
```

## Lessons Learned:

1. Be careful about what kind of comments that can end up in production. In this example, it's pretty obvious, but a dedicated attacker could piece together comments which seem erroneous, but leak a critical detail or to map out internal logic.
	1. **Fix:** Use **CI/CD pipelines** and **linters** that scan and strip out comments and strings before code hits production.
2. Security through obscurity only slows down attackers marginally, if the only thing preventing unauthorized users from accessing a sensitive resource is hiding it, the system is insecure.
	1. **Fix:** Use **formal authentication and authorisation**. Sensitive portals should be defended with **OAuth 2.0 + OIDC**. Make sure these connected accounts are defended with MFA (Multi-factor Authentication).
